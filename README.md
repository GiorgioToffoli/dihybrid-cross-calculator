This web app is an intuative [dihybrid cross calculator](https://giorgiotoffoli.github.io/dihybrid-cross-calculator/) to help you calculate allele pairs and genotype probability for two inherited traits.

## How It Works ðŸŸ£
- Insert two allele pairs in each box (expressed as letters; uppercased [A] for dominant alleles and lowercase [a] for recessive)
- Press 'Calculate'
- And _boom_, that's it!

> *For this to work best, ensure you are using the same letters [Aa Bb] (and not different letters [Ab Ba] for example) for **both** of the input boxes!*
